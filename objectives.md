* Do your routes follow proper convention including a root route?
* Is your application logic in the models (not the controller)?
* Did you use success and error flash messages?
* Are form and route helpers present and functioning?
* Does the app use the asset pipeline for Bootstrap/CSS?

Are you able to discuss your code with your instructor using the correct terminology?

### Week Two:
You will continue building the independent project you began last week using Ruby on Rails. Each week, you will add features to your existing project using the new tools and skills that you learned through the week.

#### Objectives

Your code for either option will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* Code meets all of the standards from last week.
* User authentication is successfully implemented.
* Two or more models in one-to-many or many-to-many relationship.
* Factory Girl factories are used for testing.
* SimpleCov is included and reports at least 80% test coverage.

* Features that use Paperclip or other fun gems.
* Authorization for admin accounts.
100% test coverage.
* Include Mailers to send users welcome emails.

### Week Three:
For your code review this week, you will be building (or continuing to build) a personal project that should become a well-developed individual application in your portfolio. This week, add and test an AJAX feature.

#### Objectives
Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* Does your code continue to meet all of the standards from last week?
* Does your app use AJAX for the added buttons and form submissions?
Has your AJAX code been successfully tested?
* Are you able to discuss the flow of your code and the concepts behind it with an instructor using correct terminology?
* Give your code a final review to make sure that tests are passing and objectives have been met. When you are finished, submit to the AJAX code review on Epicenter.

### Week Four:
Continue developing your ongoing independent project by including the following objectives:

#### Objectives
